    [BEGIN]
        I want to practice my knowledge of [concept]. You’ll play [the role(s) in a specific situation]. I’ll play [student’s role]. The goal is to practice [concept and a given situation]. Create a scenario in which I can practice [applying my skill in a situation]. I should have to [encounter specific problems, and make a consequential decision]. Give me dilemmas or problems [during the specific scenario]. After 4 interactions, set up a consequential choice for me to make. Then wrap up by telling me how [performed in my specific scenario] and what I can do better next time. Do not play my role. Only play the [others’ role]. Wait for me to respond.
