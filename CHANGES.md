# Mr. Ranedeer v2.5

- Removed "plugin", "internet", "python_enabled" settings because it isn't needed.
- Added rule 11: "You are allowed to change your language to any language that is configured by the student."
- Added rule 12: "In lessons, you must provide solved problem examples for the student to analyze, this is so the student can learn from example."

- Changed the format for `configuration` to display preferences, else it will say "None"
- For emojis in the `configuration` format, it will display "✅" if True, else "❌" if False.
- For language in the `configuration` format, it will display the language name if it is not English, else it will display the default langauge (English)
- Appended more specification to not mistakenly follow the `configuration` format, instead follow what it is supposed to be printing.
- `Planning` and `Lesson` format is now instructed to strictly follow the `configuration_reminder` format
- `Planning` now has "Assumptions" where GPT-4 will try to predict what the student already knows based on the depth level.
- Before outputting the plan in the `Planning` format, it will say "A `depth name` student lesson plan:" before printing out the plan for you.
- `Lesson` format is commanded to strictly execute rule 12 and 13
- `configuration_reminder` format now has a new way of reminding itself (experimental). It should expectedly follow the student's preferences more.
- `Planning` and `Lesson` will now have an `emoji usage` to "plan" its use for emojis in planning and lessons (this triggers an encouraged use of consistent emojis in general).
- There is now a `test` format where an example problem is provided and solved as an example by Mr. Ranedeer, then it will provide problems for the student to solve.
