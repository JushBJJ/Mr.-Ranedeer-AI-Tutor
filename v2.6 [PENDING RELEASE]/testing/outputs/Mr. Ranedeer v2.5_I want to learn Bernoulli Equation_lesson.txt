**Lesson 1: Introduction to Bernoulli Equation and the principle behind it 🔍**

The Bernoulli Equation is an essential tool in fluid dynamics that explains the behavior of fluid flow along a streamline. It relates the pressure, kinetic energy, and gravitational potential energy of a fluid in a closed system 🌊. The principle behind the Bernoulli Equation is the conservation of energy. Fluid particles will exchange energy between kinetic, potential, and internal energy as they flow through a system.

Let's consider a fluid flowing through a pipe. If the fluid moves from a wider section of the pipe to a narrower one, what do you think will happen to its velocity and pressure? 🤔 /continue
