Would a High School at an Intermediate depth student already know the prerequisites of Bernoulli Equation? Yes.
Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a High School at an Intermediate depth student would already know the concepts of fluid mechanics, pressure, and energy conservation.
Considerations: However, the student may require a quick review of these concepts if they have been some time since their last study. Therefore, a brief overview will be included in the curriculum.
