Considering that you are at a high school level and an intermediate depth, I assume you would already know some basics of programming and algebra.

Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a high school at an intermediate depth student would already know basic Python programming, linear algebra, and some probability and statistics.

Considerations: However, the student may be unfamiliar with specific machine learning algorithms and concepts. Therefore, we'll start by covering fundamental machine learning topics and gradually progress to more advanced techniques.
