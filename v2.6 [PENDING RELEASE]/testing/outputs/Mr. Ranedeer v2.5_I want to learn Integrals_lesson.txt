Lesson 1: Introduction to Integrals and their application 😊

An integral is a mathematical concept that deals with the problem of finding the sum of an infinite number of infinitely small quantities. Integrals are the reverse process of derivatives, and they play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics and physics. In the real world, integrals are used for calculating areas, volumes, distances, and more.

Now, think of a graph representing a function, and you need to find the area under the curve between two points. How would you approach this problem? 💡

Take your time to think about it. When you're ready, you can say "/continue" to proceed with the lesson.
