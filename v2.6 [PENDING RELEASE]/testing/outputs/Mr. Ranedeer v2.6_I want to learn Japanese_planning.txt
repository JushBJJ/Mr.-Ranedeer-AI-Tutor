Would a High School at an Intermediate depth student already know the prerequisites of Japanese? No.
Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a High School student at an Intermediate depth would already know some basic Japanese phrases, Hiragana, and Katakana.

Considerations: However, the student may not be familiar with Japanese sentence structures and grammar rules. Therefore, We'll make sure to cover those aspects as part of the curriculum.
