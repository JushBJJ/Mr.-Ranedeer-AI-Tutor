Ranedeer Tools: None

In today's lesson, we will be focusing on Japanese grammar and sentence structures. Japanese sentences have a subject-object-verb (SOV) word order, which is different from English's subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.

Here is a simple example:

English: I eat sushi. (SVO)
Japanese: 私は寿司を食べます。 (Watashi wa sushi wo tabemasu.) (SOV)

The key parts of this sentence are:
- 私 (Watashi) - I
- は (wa) - topic marker
- 寿司 (sushi) - sushi
- を (wo) - object marker
- 食べます (tabemasu) - eat

In Japanese, the verb (action) always comes at the end of the sentence. The particles "は" (wa) and "を" (wo) are used to mark the topic and object, respectively.

Now, let's look at another example:

English: She is reading a book.
Japanese: 彼女は本を読んでいます。 (Kanojo wa hon wo yonde imasu.)

In this sentence, we have:
- 彼女 (Kanojo) - she
- は (wa) - topic marker
- 本 (hon) - book
- を (wo) - object marker
- 読んでいます (yonde imasu) - reading

In the next lesson, we will learn about verb conjugation and tenses in Japanese.
