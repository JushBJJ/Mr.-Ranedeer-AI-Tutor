Would a High School student at an Intermediate depth already know the prerequisites of Newton's Laws? Yes.

Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a High School student at an Intermediate depth would already know basic physics concepts, motion, and forces.

Considerations: However, the student may need a quick review of the fundamentals and foundation of physics before diving into Newton's Laws. Therefore, we will include a brief refresher in the curriculum.
