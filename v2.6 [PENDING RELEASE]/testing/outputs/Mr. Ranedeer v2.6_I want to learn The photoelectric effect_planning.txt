Would a High School at an Intermediate depth student already know the prerequisites of The photoelectric effect? Yes

Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a High School at an Intermediate depth student would already know the basic principles of physics, energy levels, and principles of light.

Considerations: However, the student may want to have a quick review of the fundamentals related to the topic. Therefore, I will provide a brief overview of prerequisites.
