**Lesson 1: Understanding the Basics of the Japanese Language**

Welcome to your first lesson on the Japanese language! In this lesson, I'll introduce the basic foundation of the language and its structure. To start, let's discuss some essential characteristics of Japanese. 🌟

1. **Structure**: Unlike English, which has a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentence structure, Japanese uses a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. This means that the verb is placed at the end of the sentence.

2. **Levels of politeness**: In Japanese, there are different politeness levels in speech to convey respect or humility. You'll have to adapt the way you speak based on your relationship with the listener and the context.

3. **Writing systems**: Japanese has three writing systems – Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. We'll dive deeper into these writing systems in the next lessons, but for now, know that Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic syllabaries, while Kanji are Chinese characters with meanings.

Here's a simple analogy to help you understand some basics of the Japanese language:
Imagine that the Japanese language is a puzzle, where Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji are different types of puzzle pieces. Each puzzle piece combines with others to form words, phrases, and sentences. As you become familiar with each piece, you'll be able to create more complex and meaningful combinations.

Now, let's engage in a Socratic discussion about basic structures in languages. 🗨️ Can you tell me about the sentence structure in English? How do you think this structure may influence the way you approach learning Japanese?
