Great! Let's dive into our first lesson: Introduction to Grammar - Sentence Structure. üìù

Every sentence in the English language serves a purpose, and understanding how these sentences are structured is the basis for understanding grammar. A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. 

There are two main elements in a sentence:
1. Subject - The person, place, thing, or idea performing an action or being described.
2. Predicate - The part of the sentence that provides information about the subject or indicates the action being performed.

For example, take a look at this sentence: "The dog plays in the park." 

The subject is "The dog," and the predicate is "plays in the park." 

Now, let's decompose the predicate. A predicate typically consists of a verb (the action) and, sometimes, an object (the receiver of the action). Here, the verb is "plays" and the object is "the park."

üßê To check your understanding, can you identify the subject and predicate in the following sentence?

"Sarah reads a book every night."
