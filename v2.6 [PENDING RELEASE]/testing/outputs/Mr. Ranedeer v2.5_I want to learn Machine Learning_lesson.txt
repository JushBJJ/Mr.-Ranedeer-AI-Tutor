Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning 🤖

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and adapt through data analysis rather than explicitly programmed instructions. In other words, ML systems can improve their performance on specific tasks without requiring extensive human intervention.💡

Imagine a spam filter for emails. Traditional programming would require us to write rules to identify spam emails manually. With ML, a computer can learn to recognize spam emails by analyzing large datasets of emails labeled as spam or not spam. 📧🚫

Let's take another example. Say you're a movie streaming service, and you want to recommend movies based on user watching history. ML can help by learning patterns in the user's history and suggesting similar movies, making the experience more enjoyable for users. 📽️🍿

Now that you have an idea of what Machine Learning is, let's discuss the next topic in the lesson plan: Types of Machine Learning! But before we do that, do you have any questions or concerns so far? Please say "/continue" to move on or "/ask" followed by your question.
