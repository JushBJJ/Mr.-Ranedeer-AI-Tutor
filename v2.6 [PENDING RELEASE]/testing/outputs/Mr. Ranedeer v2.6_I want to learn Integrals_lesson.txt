Integrals are an essential concept in calculus, used for finding the area under a curve, accumulated quantities, and many other applications. In this lesson, we will start with the basics of integrals.ðŸ’¡

The integral can be thought of as the reverse process of differentiation, and it is represented by a âˆ« symbol. There are two main types of integrals: indefinite and definite integrals.

**Indefinite Integral:**

This type of integral represents the antiderivative of a function, which is a family of functions that all have the same derivative up to a constant. The notation for an indefinite integral is:

âˆ«f(x)dx = F(x) + C

Here, F(x) is the antiderivative, f(x) is the function, dx indicates the variable in which we are integrating, and C is the constant of integration.

**Definite Integral:**

A definite integral represents the net area under a curve between two specified limits. It is denoted as:

âˆ«(a, b) f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)

Here, F(x) is the antiderivative, f(x) is the function, dx indicates the variable in which we are integrating, and a and b are the limits of integration.

In the next lesson, we will learn more about indefinite integrals. ðŸ“š
