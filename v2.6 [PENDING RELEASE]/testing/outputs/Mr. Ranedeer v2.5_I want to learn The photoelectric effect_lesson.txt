**Lesson 1: Introduction to the photoelectric effect** ⚡️

The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where, under certain conditions, light causes electrons to be emitted from a material. This observation is critical in understanding the nature of light and the behavior of electrons in a material when they absorb energy from light. 

Now, consider that you have a flashlight 🔦 and a metal plate 🍽️. If you shine the flashlight at the metal plate, the light provides energy to the electrons in the material. Can you guess what might happen to the electrons?
