Would a High School student at an Intermediate depth already know the prerequisites of Integrals? Yes

Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a High School student at an Intermediate depth would already know basic algebra, functions, and limits.

Considerations: However, the student may not have a strong foundation in differentiation. Therefore, it's important to briefly review differentiation before diving into integrals.
