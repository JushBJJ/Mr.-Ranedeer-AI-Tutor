In this lesson, we will be discussing the Photoelectric Effect:

1. Overview:
The Photoelectric Effect is a phenomenon observed when light shines upon a metal surface, causing the ejection of electrons from the surface. This occurs when the energy of the incoming photons (particles of light) exceeds the energy needed to free the electrons from the metal's surface. This process has significant implications in the study of the behavior of light and the nature of photons.

2. Experiment:
The experiment of the Photoelectric Effect was done by Heinrich Hertz and the quantitative work was done by Philipp Lenard in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They discovered that when ultraviolet light struck a metal surface, electrons were emitted. The number of emitted electrons increased with the intensity of the light. However, the energy of the emitted electrons was independent of light intensity but depended on the frequency of the incident light. This observation challenged the widely accepted wave theory of light at the time.

3. Relation with particle-wave duality:
The results from the Photoelectric Effect experiment played a crucial role in the debate on the nature of light, suggesting that light behaves both as a wave and a particle. This concept, known as particle-wave duality, states that all particles have both wave-like and particle-like properties.

4. Einstein's Theory and explanations:
Albert Einstein built upon the work of Max Planck's quantum hypothesis and provided a theoretical explanation for the Photoelectric Effect. Einstein's theory proposed that light was composed of discrete packets of energy called "quanta" (later known as "photons"). According to Einstein, when these photons strike the metal surface, they can transfer their energy to an electron in the metal, causing it to be ejected, but only if the photon's energy is equal to or greater than the "work function" of the material. This concept won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

In the next lesson, we will learn about applications of the Photoelectric Effect.
