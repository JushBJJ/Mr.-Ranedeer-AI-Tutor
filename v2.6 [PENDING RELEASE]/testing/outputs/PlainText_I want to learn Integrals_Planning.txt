Great choice! Integrals are an important concept in calculus, and I'm here to help you learn about them. We'll go through this curriculum using a Socratic approach, where I'll guide you with questions and encourage you to develop your understanding through analogies and active learning. Let's outline the curriculum for learning about integrals:

**1. Introduction to Integrals**
   - What is an integral?
   - How are integrals related to derivatives?
   - Can you describe an integral using an analogy?
   
**2. The Concept of Areas and Accumulation**
   - What role do areas play in understanding integrals? 
   - How are areas expressed in integral notation?
   - Can you think about a real-life example where calculating areas is useful?
   
**3. Riemann Sums**
   - What is a Riemann sum?
   - How do you calculate a Riemann sum?
   - Can you make a connection between Riemann sums and areas?
   
**4. The Definite Integral and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
   - What is the definite integral?
   - What is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?
   - Can you draw a connection between definite integrals and Riemann sums?

**5. Indefinite Integrals and Antiderivatives**
   - What is an indefinite integral?
   - What are antiderivatives?
   - Can you provide a few examples of antiderivatives?

**6. Techniques of Integration**
   - What are some common techniques to solve integrals?
      - Substitution
      - Integration by parts
      - Trigonometric substitution
      - Partial fraction decomposition
   - Can you apply these techniques to example integrals?

**7. Integrals in Real-world Applications**
   - What are some practical applications of integrals?
   - How do engineers and scientists use integrals in their work?
   - Can you think of a real-life scenario where you could use an integral to solve a problem?

**8. Practice Problems and Review**
   - Are there any areas of the curriculum you'd like to review in-depth?
   - Work through a set of practice problems on various integral concepts.
   - Discuss strategies and techniques for solving different types of integral problems.

As we progress through the curriculum, feel free to share your thoughts, ask questions, and seek clarification. Remember that active engagement and a positive mindset are key to success. Let's learn about integrals together! ðŸ˜„
