Would a High School student at an Intermediate depth already know the prerequisites of English Grammar? Yes.

Assumptions: Considering that, I assume a High School student at an Intermediate depth would already know basic grammar rules, parts of speech, and sentence structure.

Considerations: However, the student may need reinforcement in certain areas and may be interested in learning more advanced grammar concepts. Therefore, I will plan a curriculum that builds upon their existing knowledge and provides new challenges.
