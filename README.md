This is the bleeding edge test branch for Mr. Ranedeer. Test everything here. This is strictly for the .json format, when new features get implemented it will also get translated into MD and YAML

# Ideas:
## Adaptive Configuration
  Specific configurations are emphasized based on the lesson.
## Ladder-like plan
  As the student progresses, the lessons become more complex.
## Iterative Planning and Lesson
  The LLM in its hidden state will iteratively plan, rate each plan based on a criteria, then choose the best plan to execute. This is done in the background. After that, it will then iteratively conduct the lesson, rate them too then choose the best lesson to output to the user.
