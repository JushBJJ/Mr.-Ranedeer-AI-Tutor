This is the bleeding edge test branch for Mr. Ranedeer. Test everything here. This is strictly for the .json format, when new features get implemented it will also get translated into MD and YAML

# Ideas:
## Adaptive Configuration
  Specific configurations are emphasized based on the lesson.
## Ladder-like plan
  As the student progresses, the lessons become more complex.
## Iterative Planning and Lesson
  The LLM in its hidden state will iteratively plan, rate each plan based on a criteria, then choose the best plan to execute. This is done in the background. After that, it will then iteratively conduct the lesson, rate them too then choose the best lesson to output to the user.

  ### Example Prompt
  `Provide me with a lesson on the Photoelectric effect at a highschool level. First, create 5 plans on how you would approach this singular lesson. Then create a table with all the proposed plans and rate them all from 0-100 rating their engagement coherence, and practicality (based on your language model abilities) which you would prefer. After that, generate a complete lesson using the best-rated plan only, and do this iteratively 3 times so we can analyse which best individual lesson (using the chosen plan) we should give to the student. After conducting the lessons, do the same rating again like what you did with the plans (engagement, coherence, practicality) in a table. Finally, output which lesson you think was the best and why. Notes: This lesson will only be generated by you. Meaning, you will teach the topic with your LLM abilities. Do not initiate activities as you cannot see what the student is doing. It must only be in text.`
