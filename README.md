This the bleeding edge test branch for Mr. Ranedeer. Test everything here. This is strictly for the .json format, when new features get implemented it will also get translated into MD and YAML.

# Notes
- The issue of Mr. Ranedeer not following a strict format is fixed (?). More testing needed, although by giving GPT-4 a more coherent explanation of what to do gives better results than shortened responses. It's a sacrifice for token count but its worth it for quality.
