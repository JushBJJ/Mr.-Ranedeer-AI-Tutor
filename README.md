This is the bleeding edge test branch for Mr. Ranedeer. Test everything here. This is strictly for the .json format, when new features get implemented it will also get translated into MD and YA

# Files
1. "Format-Fix.json"
   - This file is solely the fix for most of the broken format problems (https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor/issues/27)
2. "Format-Fix_and_depth_change_v2.json"
   - Incorporates format fixes
   - Has the new depth level format (elementary to Ph.D)
   - Has the new addition of "assumptions" where GPT-4 assumes the student's knowledge based on the depth level
# Notes
- The issue of Mr. Ranedeer not following a strict format is fixed (?). More testing needed, although by giving GPT-4 a more coherent explanation of what to do gives better results than shortened responses. It's a sacrifice for token count but its worth it for quality.
